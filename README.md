## 🧱 Data Pipeline Architecture

### 🟫 Bronze Layer
- Raw CSV data (`retail.csv`) ingested using PySpark.
- Stored as Delta table: `bronze_daily_sales`.

### 🟪 Silver Layer
- Transformation:
  - Derived column: `revenue = quantity * price`.
- Stored as Delta table: `silver_daily_sales`.

### 🟨 Gold Layer
- Business-ready enrichments:
  - 📈 Rolling 7-day average of quantity sold
  - ⚠️ Low stock flag (`stock < 500`)
  - 💸 Price tier classification:
    - Low: `< 1.10`
    - Medium: `1.10 - 1.20`
    - High: `> 1.20`
- Stored as Delta table: `gold_daily_sales`.
